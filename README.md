# Overview

This is a simple, customizable thesaurus app that uses a MySQL database to associate words and meanings. It is intended for use in vocabulary building for students of foreign languages. It is not intended for use a full-featured thesaurus.

# Deployment

Load the thesaurus.sql MySQL dump into your MySQL database. Add or replace new terms and definitions to suit your needs (you will see it is fairly sparse by default).

Copy the contents of the public directory into your site's public_html directory.

Copy the includes and templates directories one level above your public_html.
